          On top of our initial discovery with Syfy, we will conduct further discovery sessions with USA as well as with other brands to learn about their Press Kit platforms, workflow, pain points, and wants.

        <div class="content-description">
          If there is a need to keep the Press Site CMS separate from the main CMS, we will consult the engineering team with the technical details on having a separate CMS instance using Concerto as the base.

        <div class="content-description">
          For Press Site, we would also need to explore on reusing the existing Content Types vs. creating new ones just for Press Site.
        </div>
        <div class="content-description">
          Then, we will conduct Ideation Session and User Testing (2 weeks) to create a prototype and validate our workflow and UI.
