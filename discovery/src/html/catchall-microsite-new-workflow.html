They are both one-page, one-off pages that potentially has content from CMS and/or custom code. Microsite is more structured with the navigation and potential sponsorship opportunities compared to Catchall page. In a way, Microsite is containing sections divided with navigation as their titles, and each section has the same capability that Catchall page has.</div>
          <div class="content-description">Thus, the unified content type would have a Type selector, which would display additional sections and fields for the navigation and sponsorship upon selecting Microsite option.</div>
