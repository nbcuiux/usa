          <div class="content-description">The item search in Collection needs to offer more information than just the title and the content type, as well as the option to further filter down the result. As Promo Wrappers’ titles would be consumer-facing, the titles may be quite generic, like the title of the series as in the example. Thus, there can be multiple Promo Wrappers and Content Type itself that have the same title, and it would become impossible to distinguish one from the others. There should be a thumbnail, unique number ID, date created/modified, and/or the creator/modifier in order to distinguish the items from the massive library of content.</div>
          <div class="content-description">Alternatively, each content type can have “Administrative Title” that is only for internal search purposes. Then the producer can give unique title to the Promo Wrappers and other contents without having to name it for consumer-facing purposes.</div>

          <div class="content-description">Based on USA’s current use case, there is a need to schedule the time of the A-spot content to go live. This can be achieved by one of the following two options:</div>
          <div class="content-description">1. Each item can be scheduled to go into/removed from the Collection. This option reuses the “Homepage A-spot” Collection and reduces the number of Collection that lives on the CMS. The downside of this is that the producers can’t reuse the Collection that was previously up on the site. Use case of this case, however, would be very minimal, if any.</div>
          <div class="content-description">2. Entire Collection can be scheduled to go into/removed from the Collection Group. This saves all the Collections that were ever created on the CMS, thus makes it easy to retrieve the A-spot that was created in the past. However, this would create new Collection each day - USA schedules to update the Homepage A-spot every day - and eventually weigh down the CMS.</div>
